Dynamic programming (abbreviated DP), is an approach to solving problems through 'clever bruteforce'. It is a technique that combines the correctness of complete search and the efficiency of greedy algorithms. Dynamic programming can
be applied if the problem can be divided into overlapping subproblems that can be solved independently.

There are two common uses for dynamic programming:
* **Finding an optimal solution**: You want to find a solution that is as large as possible or as small as possible.
* **Counting the number of solutions**: You want to calculate the total number of possible solutions.

If you're following this series, DP could be quite a jump in terms of difficulty and thinking of approaches to problems. Take your time to assimilate the contents of the following links/guides and understand what's going on. The internet has a lot more resources to explore if you're stuck.

The links that follow are good to start with, but you will most probably have to revisit and re-read them multiple times as you struggle through the components that follow.
