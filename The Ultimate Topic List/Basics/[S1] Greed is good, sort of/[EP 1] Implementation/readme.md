# Ad hoc/Implementation
Implementation problems do not rely on the knowledge of any particular data structure or algorithm. There isn't really any way to learn this method except to practice problems.

**Note:** Sometimes the input may be large enough to cause an overflow. So remember to use `long long` (64-bit integer) instead of `int` (32-bit integer). It is safe to assume anything above 2∙10<sup>9</sup> overflows `int`, and anything above 2∙10<sup>18</sup> overflows `long long int`.

Problems mentioned in this episode, as well as subsequent ones, are only meant to serve as an introduction to a topic and are by no means enough to make you an expert at it (unless you are a genius). Be sure to practice more problems on the topics. You may go to [Problemset](https://codeforces.com/problemset) on Codeforces and filter by tag and/or rating to find appropriate problems.

Also note that most codeforces problems have editorials (explanations of solutions). You can find them on the bottom right, usually labelled 'Tutorial'. Read them if you are stuck.
